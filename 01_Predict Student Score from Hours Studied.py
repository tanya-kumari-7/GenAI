# Creating the dataset
''' The dataset consists of hours studied and the corresponding scores obtained by the students in an exam.
    The dataset is represented as a 2D array for hours and a 1D array for scores.
    The hours array is a 2D array with shape (6, 1) and the scores array is a 1D array with shape (6,).
    The hours array contains the number of hours studied by the students and the scores array contains the corresponding scores obtained by the students.
    The dataset is as follows:
    Hours studied: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
    Scores obtained: 30, 50, 65, 70, 75, 85 '''


hours = np.array([[1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6]])

# Train the model using the dataset
""" The LinearRegression class is used to create a linear regression model.
