You said:
False Negative (FN)


ChatGPT said:
✅ Correct!

Here's why:

Actual condition: It's fraud (so, it should be flagged as a positive case).

Model's prediction: The model said it’s genuine (which is a negative prediction).

So, the model missed the fraud. This is a False Negative (FN).

🔄 Quick Recap:
False Negative (FN) = The model said "No fraud" when it was actually fraud.

False Positive (FP) = The model said "Fraud" when it was actually genuine.
