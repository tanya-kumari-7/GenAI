## ðŸŽ¯ Scenario 4:
You are building a model for hiring candidates from resumes. You want to make sure that selected candidates are truly qualified, but also donâ€™t want to miss out on great candidates. Both FP (bad hires) and FN (missed talent) are equally bad.

Which metric should you focus on?







You said:
F1 score which 2* (precision * recall)/(precision + recall)

Boom! ðŸ’¥ Spot on!

## âœ… Correct Answer: F1 Score
Why?
You correctly identified that both:

False Positives (hiring unqualified candidates)

False Negatives (missing great talent)
...are equally important to avoid.

In such balanced trade-off cases:
Precision ensures: Those you hire are truly good.

Recall ensures: Youâ€™re not missing out on good candidates.

F1 Score is the harmonic mean of Precision & Recall â€” it gives a balanced performance metric when both errors matter.

ðŸŽ¯ Summary So Far:
Scenario	Focus Metric
Disease Detection	Recall
Spam Email	Precision
Fraud Detection	Recall
Candidate Hiring (both matter)	F1 Score
