## 🔢 Scenario 3:
You're working on a face recognition system for unlocking a smartphone. It should unlock only for the authorized person. If it fails to unlock sometimes for the real user, that’s annoying. But if it unlocks for someone else, that’s a security risk.

Which metric should you focus on?

✅ Spot on! 🙌

🔐 Face Recognition → F1 Score
False Positive (FP) = Unauthorized person gets access → security risk 🔓

False Negative (FN) = Authorized person can’t unlock the phone → inconvenient, but not a huge security threat.

Since both errors (FP and FN) are equally harmful, we focus on the F1 Score — it balances Precision and Recall for the best overall performance.
