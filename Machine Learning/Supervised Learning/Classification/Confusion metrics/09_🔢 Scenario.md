âœ… Correct again!

ðŸ“§ Email Verification â†’ Precision
False Positive (FP) = A valid email is rejected â†’ big problem; the user cannot receive important communications.

False Negative (FN) = An invalid email is accepted â†’ minor inconvenience for the user.

When rejecting valid emails (FP) is the bigger issue, we focus on Precision to make sure the emails we accept are truly valid.
