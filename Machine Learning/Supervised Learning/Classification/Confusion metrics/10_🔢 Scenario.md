ðŸŽ¥ Video Recommendation â†’ F1 Score
False Positive (FP) = Recommending irrelevant videos â†’ Annoying for users, might lead to disengagement.

False Negative (FN) = Missing out on videos they wouldâ€™ve liked â†’ Less engagement.

Since both bad recommendations and missed good ones hurt user experience, we aim for a balance â†’ F1 Score.

ðŸ”¥ Youâ€™re doing great. Letâ€™s keep up the momentum.
