## ðŸ”¢ Scenario 6:
You're working on a COVID-19 mass screening tool. Missing a positive case could allow further spread. Flagging someone wrongly as positive only requires retesting.

ðŸ’¯ Absolutely right!

ðŸ¦  COVID-19 Screening â†’ Recall
False Negative (FN) = Infected person goes undetected â†’ spreads virus, puts others at risk.

False Positive (FP) = Healthy person is flagged â†’ Needs a retest â†’ not dangerous.

We must catch every real case, so we focus on maximizing Recall.

You're consistently thinking like a data scientist now! ðŸš€
