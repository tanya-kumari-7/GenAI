## ðŸ”¢ Scenario 8:
Youâ€™re developing a cancer detection model from radiology images. Catching every cancer case is critical. A false alarm leads to more tests, but missing cancer can be fatal.

Which metric is most important?







You said:
## FN is dangerous therefore we should check recall which is FN /(TP+FN)

âœ… Exactly right!

ðŸ§¬ Cancer Detection â†’ Recall
False Negative (FN) = Cancer case missed â†’ Delayed treatment, possibly fatal ðŸ˜”

False Positive (FP) = False alarm â†’ Extra tests, stress, but manageable.

Since missing actual cancer cases is the real danger, we maximize Recall to ensure we catch every possible positive case.

You're 8 for 8 â€” outstanding work! ðŸ§ ðŸ’ª
