🔍 Good thinking! F1-score is a solid choice when you want a balance.
Let’s break it down to confirm your answer.

🔁 Scenario Review:
Situation	Mistake	Impact
Good candidate rejected	False Negative (FN)	Lose talent
Bad candidate shortlisted	False Positive (FP)	Waste interview time

So:

Both FP and FN have consequences.

But FN (missing good candidates) might be slightly worse in long-term hiring.

Still, both types of errors matter.

✅ Therefore:
You're right — F1 Score is a good metric here.

F1 = Harmonic mean of Precision and Recall

Use F1 when:

Both Precision (avoid bad candidates) and Recall (catch good candidates) are important.

Data is imbalanced or when cost of FP and FN are both high.
