Question 3: Medical Test Scenario
A test checks if a person has a rare disease.
Out of 1,000 people:

50 actually have the disease

The test correctly identifies 45 of them as positive

It misses 5 (marked them as negative)

It wrongly flags 30 healthy people as positive

It correctly says 920 are negative

Can you fill in the confusion matrix (TP, FP, TN, FN)?


TP:  45
FP: 30
TN: 920
FN: 5
