Question 5: Weather Prediction (Rain or No Rain)
A weather model predicts whether it will rain tomorrow.
Out of 200 days:

50 days it rained

The model predicted rain on 45 of those 50 days correctly

It missed 5 days when it actually rained

It incorrectly predicted rain on 10 days when it didnâ€™t rain

It correctly predicted no rain on the remaining 140 days

Can you fill in the confusion matrix (TP, FP, TN, FN)?
