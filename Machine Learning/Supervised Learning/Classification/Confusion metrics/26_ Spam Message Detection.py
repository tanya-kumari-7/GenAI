ðŸ”¹ Question 9: Spam Message Detection
An SMS classifier predicts whether a message is spam or not.

Out of 2,500 messages:

400 were actually spam

The model correctly flagged 350 as spam

It missed 50 spam messages

It incorrectly marked 100 non-spam messages as spam

The rest were correctly marked as not spam

Can you fill in the confusion matrix (TP, FP, TN, FN)?


TP:  350
FN: 50
FP: 100
TN: 2000
