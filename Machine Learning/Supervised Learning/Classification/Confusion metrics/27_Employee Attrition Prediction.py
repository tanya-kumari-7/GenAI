ðŸ”¹ Question 10: Employee Attrition Prediction
A company uses a model to predict which employees might leave.

Out of 1,000 employees:

200 actually left

The model correctly predicted 160 would leave

It missed 40 who did leave

It wrongly predicted 60 would leave when they didnâ€™t

The rest were correctly predicted to stay

Can you fill in the confusion matrix (TP, FP, TN, FN)?


Q10.


TP:  160
FN: 40
FP: 60
TN: 740
