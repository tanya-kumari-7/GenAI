🧳 Scenario: Baggage Screening at the Airport
You work as part of an airport security system, checking bags for dangerous items like weapons or explosives.

Positive result = The system says "Dangerous item detected".

Negative result = The system says "No dangerous item".

🔍 Situation:
A passenger actually has a dangerous item in their bag (this is the true condition).
But the system predicts that the bag does not contain any dangerous item (it says "No").

❓Question:
What is this?

True Positive (TP)

True Negative (TN)

False Positive (FP)

False Negative (FN)

And why?

Take your time!

You're absolutely right — FN (False Negative) is the correct answer!

✅ Why it's False Negative:
Actual: The bag does contain a dangerous item → Positive case.

Prediction: The system said "No dangerous item" → Negative prediction.

Result: The system missed detecting the danger → ❌ Wrong prediction → False Negative.

🚨 Real-life consequence:
In this case, a False Negative is dangerous because the system failed to catch a serious threat — a real danger was missed.
