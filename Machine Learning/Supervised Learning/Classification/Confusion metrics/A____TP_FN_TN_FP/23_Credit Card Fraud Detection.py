Question 6: Credit Card Fraud Detection
A bank runs a model to detect fraudulent transactions.

Out of 10,000 transactions:

100 were actually fraud

The model correctly detected 90 of them

It missed 10 frauds

It incorrectly flagged 50 legitimate transactions as fraud

The rest were correctly identified as legitimate

Can you fill in the confusion matrix (TP, FP, TN, FN)?

Go ahead!
