Question 8: COVID Test Result Prediction
A model is used to predict if someone has COVID based on symptoms.

Out of 2,000 people tested:

300 actually had COVID

The model correctly identified 270 of them

It missed 30 people who actually had COVID

It falsely flagged 40 healthy people as COVID-positive

The rest were correctly identified as healthy

Can you fill in the confusion matrix (TP, FP, TN, FN)?

Your turn!
