Great! Here's the final one for now:

ðŸ”¹ Question 16: Disease Diagnosis AI
Out of 4,000 patients tested:

500 actually had the disease

The AI correctly identified 460 of them

It missed 40

It falsely diagnosed 70 healthy patients

The rest were correctly diagnosed as healthy

Can you fill in the confusion matrix (TP, FP, TN, FN)?

TP:  460
FN: 40
FP: 70
TN: 3430
