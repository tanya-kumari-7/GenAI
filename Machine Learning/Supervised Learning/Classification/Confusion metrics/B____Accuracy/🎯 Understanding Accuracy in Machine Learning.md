# 🎯 Understanding Accuracy in Machine Learning

Let's dive deep into **Accuracy** — a fundamental yet sometimes misunderstood metric in machine learning.  
We’ll explore what it is, how to calculate it, when it’s useful, when it can mislead you, and compare it with other metrics.

## 🔍 What is Accuracy?

**Accuracy tells us how often the model is correct overall.**

### ✅ Definition:

\[
\text{Accuracy} = \frac{TP + TN}{TP + TN + FP + FN}
\]

Where:
- **TP** = True Positives  
- **TN** = True Negatives  
- **FP** = False Positives  
- **FN** = False Negatives  

> It measures:  
> ✅ Correct Predictions / 🔢 Total Predictions

---

## 📦 Example:

Suppose a model is tested on **100 cases**:

- TP = 40 → Correctly predicted disease  
- TN = 50 → Correctly predicted no disease  
- FP = 5  → Wrongly predicted disease  
- FN = 5  → Missed actual disease  

\[
\text{Accuracy} = \frac{40 + 50}{40 + 50 + 5 + 5} = \frac{90}{100} = 0.90 = 90\%
\]

✅ **Interpretation:** The model was correct in 90 out of 100 cases.

---

## ✅ When is Accuracy Useful?

- When **class distribution is balanced** (e.g. positives ≈ negatives)
- When **all errors have equal cost**
- For **initial sanity checks** on model performance

---

## ⚠️ When Accuracy Can Be Misleading

### ❗ Accuracy Paradox

In **imbalanced datasets**, accuracy can hide poor performance.

---

### 🔴 Example:

**Fraud Detection Model:**

- 980 non-fraud cases  
- 20 fraud cases  
- Model predicts “non-fraud” for **every** case

\[
\text{Accuracy} = \frac{980}{1000} = 98\%
\]

But:

- **Recall = 0%** → Missed all fraud  
- **Precision = 0 or undefined**  
- **F1 Score = 0**

🚨 **98% accuracy is useless** here — because it missed the fraud, the very thing we care about.

## 🎯 Key Points to Remember

| Metric    | Measures                     | Best When                              |
|-----------|------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Accuracy  | Overall correctness           | Balanced data, equal error costs       |
| Precision | % of predicted positives that are correct | False positives are costly      |
| Recall    | % of actual positives detected| False negatives are costly             |
| F1 Score  | Balance between precision & recall | You need both precision & recall |

---

## 🧠 Tips to Understand & Remember

### 🔤 Think of it as:
> **Accuracy = All Correct Predictions / All Cases**

### 🧪 Analogy:
A test has **10 questions**, and you got **9 correct**.  
Your accuracy is **90%**, regardless of which one you missed.

## 📊 Accuracy in the Confusion Matrix

|                  | Predicted Positive | Predicted Negative |
|------------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| **Actual Positive** | TP                 | FN                 |
| **Actual Negative** | FP                 | TN                 |

Then:

\[
\text{Accuracy} = \frac{TP + TN}{TP + TN + FP + FN}
\]

---

## 🧪 Practical Use-Cases

| Use-Case             | Accuracy Good? | Why or Why Not?                             |
|----------------------|----------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Spam Detection       | ❌ Not always   | FP (wrongly marking important emails) hurts |
| Cancer Diagnosis     | ❌ No           | FN (missing disease) can be fatal           |
| Image Classification | ✅ Usually      | Often class-balanced                        |
| Sentiment Analysis   | ✅/❌ Depends   | Depends on class distribution               |

---

## 🔁 In Summary

- ✅ **Accuracy** = How often your model is right.
- ⚖️ Great when dataset is **balanced** and all errors **equally matter**.
- 🚫 Don’t rely **only** on accuracy for **imbalanced data**.
- 👀 Always check **Precision, Recall, and F1 Score** too.
