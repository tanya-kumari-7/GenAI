# 🧠 Classification: A Complete Guide

## 📘 1. What is Classification?

Classification is a **supervised learning** problem where the goal is to predict a **category label (discrete output)** for a given input.

### 🎯 Example Use Cases:

| Problem               | Input             | Output             |
|-----------------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Email spam detection  | Email text        | Spam / Not spam     |
| Disease diagnosis     | Patient records   | Disease / No Disease|
| Image recognition     | Pixel values      | Cat / Dog / Bird    |
| Credit scoring        | Financial history | Good / Bad credit   |

## 🔢 2. Types of Classification

1. **Binary Classification**  
   → Only two classes  
   _Example_: Fraud or Not Fraud

2. **Multiclass Classification**  
   → More than two classes  
   _Example_: Digit recognition (0–9)

3. **Multilabel Classification**  
   → Input can belong to multiple classes simultaneously  
   _Example_: An image may be both "outdoor" and "sunset"

## 🛠️ 4. Popular Classification Algorithms

### 🔹 Linear Models
- **Logistic Regression** – Predicts probability using a sigmoid function.

### 🔹 Tree-Based Models
- **Decision Trees** – Rules based on feature splits.  
- **Random Forest** – Ensemble of decision trees.  
- **Gradient Boosting (XGBoost, LightGBM)** – Corrects weak learners iteratively.

### 🔹 Distance-Based
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** – Based on nearest neighbors’ majority class.

### 🔹 Probabilistic Models
- **Naive Bayes** – Assumes feature independence; good for text.

### 🔹 Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Maximizes the margin using hyperplanes.

### 🔹 Neural Networks
- CNNs, RNNs – Work well with images, audio, text sequences.

## ⚖️ 5. Evaluation Metrics

### 🔹 Confusion Matrix:

| Actual \ Predicted | Positive | Negative |
|---------------------|----------|----------|
| Positive            | TP       | FN       |
| Negative            | FP       | TN       |

### 🔹 Derived Metrics:
- **Accuracy** = (TP + TN) / Total  
- **Precision** = TP / (TP + FP)  
- **Recall (Sensitivity)** = TP / (TP + FN)  
- **F1 Score** = 2 * (Precision * Recall) / (Precision + Recall)  
- **AUC-ROC** – Measures separability of classes.  
- **Log Loss** – Penalizes confident wrong predictions.
