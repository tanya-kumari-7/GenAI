Clustering means grouping similar things together — just like how we group toys or fruits.

## 🍌 Real-Life Example #1: Grouping Fruits

Let’s say we give a baby a basket full of mixed fruits:

- Bananas 🍌  
- Apples 🍎  
- Oranges 🍊  

We ask the baby to group them, but we **don’t tell them the names**.

The baby looks at shape, color, and size:

- **Yellow and long** → 🍌 in one group  
- **Round and red** → 🍎 in another group  
- **Round and orange** → 🍊 in a third group

👉 **This is clustering** — grouping based on **similarity**, without knowing names or labels.
