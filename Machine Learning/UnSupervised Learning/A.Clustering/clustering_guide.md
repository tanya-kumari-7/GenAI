# Clustering - Complete Master Guide

---

## What is Clustering?

Clustering is an unsupervised learning technique used to group similar data points together. Each group is called a cluster.

**Goal:**

- Maximize intra-cluster similarity (points in the same cluster are alike)
- Minimize inter-cluster similarity (points in different clusters are different)

**Example:** Grouping customers based on behavior.

---

## Why Use Clustering?

- Understand patterns in data
- Discover hidden groups
- Segment customers/users
- Summarize large datasets
- Detect anomalies
- Improve recommendations

---

## How Does Clustering Work?

1. **Input:** Dataset with multiple features (no labels)
2. Algorithm looks for similarities/patterns
3. Each data point is assigned to a cluster
4. Analyze clusters and interpret results

---

## Distance Metrics

Distance or similarity determines how close two points are:

| Metric             | Description            |
| ------------------ | ---------------------- |
| Euclidean Distance | Straight-line distance |
| Manhattan Distance | Grid-like distance     |
| Cosine Similarity  | Angle between vectors  |

## Popular Clustering Algorithms

### 1. K-Means Clustering

**Concept:** Partition data into K clusters, minimizing intra-cluster variance.

**Steps:**

1. Choose K clusters
2. Randomly assign centroids
3. Assign points to nearest centroid
4. Recalculate centroids
5. Repeat until convergence

**Pros:**

- Fast and scalable
- Easy to understand

**Cons:**

- Must choose K
- Sensitive to outliers
- Works best for spherical clusters

---

### 2. DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise)

**Concept:** Clusters based on density â€” finds core points, border points, and outliers.

**Pros:**

- Finds clusters of arbitrary shapes
- Handles noise
- No need to choose K

**Cons:**

- Struggles with varying density
- Needs careful choice of `eps` and `min_samples`

---

### 3. Hierarchical Clustering

**Concept:** Builds a tree of clusters (dendrogram) based on distances.

**Types:**

- Agglomerative (bottom-up)
- Divisive (top-down)

**Pros:**

- No need to choose K initially
- Visual and interpretable

**Cons:**

- Slow for large datasets

## Challenges in Clustering

- Choosing K (for K-Means)
- Curse of dimensionality
- Scaling features
- Interpreting results

## Evaluating Clustering Performance

| Metric           | Purpose                               |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Silhouette Score | How well points fit in their cluster  |
| Elbow Method     | Optimal number of clusters            |
| Davies-Bouldin   | Ratio of intra/inter-cluster distance |
| Dunn Index       | Cluster separation quality            |

## Python Example - K-Means

```python
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
from sklearn.datasets import make_blobs
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Generate sample data
X, y = make_blobs(n_samples=300, centers=4, cluster_std=0.6, random_state=0)

# Apply KMeans
kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=4)
kmeans.fit(X)
y_kmeans = kmeans.predict(X)

# Plot
plt.scatter(X[:, 0], X[:, 1], c=y_kmeans, cmap='viridis')
plt.scatter(kmeans.cluster_centers_[:, 0], kmeans.cluster_centers_[:, 1], s=300, c='red')
plt.show()
```
