# Unsupervised Learning - Complete Guide

## What is Unsupervised Learning?

Unsupervised learning is a branch of Machine Learning (ML) where you train a model without labeled data. The goal is to discover patterns, structures, or relationships in the data.

**Example:**\
You give a model photos of people without names, genders, or ages. The model finds natural groupings of similar people based on appearance.

## Why Use Unsupervised Learning?

- When you don’t have labeled data — very common in the real world.
- To explore data and understand its structure.
- To prepare features for other models (feature engineering).
- To reduce noise and simplify complex data.

## Main Categories of Unsupervised Learning

### Clustering

Group data points into clusters:

- Points within the same cluster are similar.
- Points in different clusters are dissimilar.

**Algorithms:**

| Algorithm               | Strengths                             | Example               |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| K-Means                 | Fast & simple                         | Customer segmentation |
| DBSCAN                  | Handles noise, finds irregular shapes | Fraud detection       |
| Hierarchical Clustering | Builds hierarchy/tree of clusters     | Taxonomies in biology |

### Dimensionality Reduction

Compress data while preserving the most informative components.

**Benefits:**

- Speeds up models
- Removes noise
- Helps visualize data
- Reduces overfitting

**Algorithms:**

| Algorithm    | Purpose                                     |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| PCA          | Reduce dimensions, linear                   |
| t-SNE        | Visualization, preserves local structure    |
| Autoencoders | Neural nets that compress & decompress data |

### Anomaly Detection

Find rare or unusual patterns in data.

**Examples:**

- Fraud detection in transactions
- Network intrusion detection
- Fault detection in manufacturing

**Algorithms:**

- Isolation Forest
- One-Class SVM
- Local Outlier Factor

## How Does It Work?

**Example: Clustering Customers**

| Customer ID | Age | Income | Spending Score |
| ----------- | --- | ------ | -------------- |
| 101         | 25  | 35k    | 80             |
| 102         | 50  | 120k   | 30             |

**Steps:**

1. Standardize the data
2. Run K-Means with 3 clusters
3. Model assigns each customer to a cluster

**Result:**

Find groups such as:

- Young + Low Income + High Spending
- Older + High Income + Low Spending
- Middle-aged + Medium Spending

**Business action:** Customize marketing campaigns per group.

## Key Math Concepts

- **Distance Metrics:** Euclidean, Manhattan, Cosine Similarity
- **Variance and Covariance:** In PCA
- **Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors:** In PCA to rotate feature space

## Challenges of Unsupervised Learning

- No clear "right answer"
- Number of clusters must often be guessed
- Interpretation of clusters requires domain knowledge
- Sensitive to noise and outliers

---

## Evaluating Unsupervised Models

**Clustering:**

- Silhouette Score
- Dunn Index
- Elbow Method

**Dimensionality Reduction:**

- Explained Variance (PCA)
- Visual inspection (t-SNE plots)
