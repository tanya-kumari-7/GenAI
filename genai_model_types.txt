Types of Generative AI Models
=============================

1. Text Generation Models
--------------------------
These models generate human-like text.

Examples:
- **GPT (Generative Pretrained Transformer)**: ChatGPT by OpenAI
- **BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)**: Good for understanding context but not for generation
- **T5 (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer)**: Converts all NLP tasks into a text-to-text format

Use Cases:
- Chatbots
- Writing assistants
- Summarization
- Translation
- Content creation

2. Image Generation Models
--------------------------
These models generate realistic images from text or noise.

Examples:
- **DALL·E**: Text to image generation (by OpenAI)
- **Stable Diffusion**: Open-source image generation
- **Midjourney**: Artistic, stylized image creation
- **GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks)**: Two networks (generator and discriminator) trained together

Use Cases:
- Art and design
- Advertising
- Fashion
- Game development

3. Audio & Music Generation Models
----------------------------------
These models create realistic audio, music, or voice from text or other audio.

Examples:
- **Suno.ai**: Music generation from prompts
- **Jukebox (OpenAI)**: Music in different styles
- **Google MusicLM**: Generate high-quality music from descriptions

Use Cases:
- Music composition
- Podcasts
- Voiceovers
- Virtual assistants

4. Video Generation Models
---------------------------
These models generate video clips using text or a few sample frames.

Examples:
- **Runway ML**: Text-to-video and video editing
- **Make-A-Video (Meta)**: Experimental text-to-video generation
- **Synthesia**: AI avatars and presenters for business videos

Use Cases:
- Marketing
- Education
- Films and animation

5. Code Generation Models
--------------------------
These models help write or complete programming code.

Examples:
- **GitHub Copilot**: Code suggestion and generation (by OpenAI + GitHub)
- **CodeGen**: Code generation based on natural language
- **AlphaCode (DeepMind)**: Competitive programming generation

Use Cases:
- Software development
- Auto-complete in IDEs
- Learning code logic

6. Multimodal Models
---------------------
These models can work across multiple data types like text + image or text + audio.

Examples:
- **GPT-4 with Vision (GPT-4V)**: Accepts text and image input
- **CLIP (Contrastive Language–Image Pretraining)**: Understands the relationship between images and text
- **Flamingo (DeepMind)**: Multimodal few-shot learning

Use Cases:
- Smart search
- Accessibility
- Creative storytelling (e.g., image + voice)
